# ConvertKit Editor Plugin Demo

This directory serves as an example of how you can structure your application to respond to ConvertKit's editor plugin framework. It contains a _search_ endpoint, which can respond to requests from the ConvertKit sidebar, and an _HTML_ endpoint, which can generate an element for the editor based on the user's selected settings. You can view the comments in `index.js` to learn more about the implementation.

If you want to run this app locally, you can do so by running:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

These endpoints assume that your plugin would be structured as follows on your [plugin dashboard](https://app.convertkit.com/account_settings/developer_settings)  ([requires developer access](https://convertkit.typeform.com/to/nsTUorqw)).
